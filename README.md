# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Using Kickstarter data on fundraising campaigns from 2009 through 2017, we sought to help a playwright understand how well past campaigns for theater projects had performed. 

### Purpose
The playwright Louise (who uses one name only) has recently undertaken her first Kickstarter campaign, to fund her new play, _Fever_. That campaign, which was planned using the results of analyses of a Kickstarter data set 2009-2017, performed well, coming close to its goal in a short amount of time. 

Louise requested further analysis of the same data set, to better understand:
    * the relationship between launch date and campaign outcome, for all theater-related campaigns (which include campaigns to support musicals, plays, and theater spaces)
    * the relationship between goal size and campaign outcome, for plays (as a subset of theater campaigns)

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To better understand the effect of launch timing, we selected all theater-related campaign data. We then compared the month of campaign's launch and campaign outcome, as presented in the chart below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To better understand the relationship between the campaign's goal and campaign outcome, we selected all play-related campaign data. To simplify our presentation, we grouped data about goal amounts into the following categories:
 * less than $1,000
 * $1,000 - $4,999
 * $5,000 - $9,999
 * $10,000 - $14,999
 * $15,000 - $19,999
 * $20,000 - $24,999
 * $25,000 - $29,999
 * $30,000 - $34,999
 * $35,000 - $39,999
 * $40,000 - $44,999
 * $45,000 - $49,999
 * $50,000 or more

 The analysis is summarized in the chart below.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
